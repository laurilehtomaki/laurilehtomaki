- 👋 Hi, I’m @laurilehtomaki
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and technology generally. Most of the stuff I do is somehow related to my work as Process (Piping) Design Engineer and I do stuff to eace my daily routines.
This includes but is not limited to Excel custom formulas, addons and powershell scripts, but it's not always the case. If I found something new and interesting, I'll give it a try.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Powershell, Excel scripts with Javascript API, Python.. In future, I'm willing to expand my scope on other Microsoft 365 Tools.
- 💞️ In long term, I've dreamed of changing my career to more IT related. If you have something that could help my dream come true, let me know.
- 📫 you can contact me by mail, laurilehtomaki@gmail.com
